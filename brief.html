            <h2 class="mt-5">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Totoro Hill is an invitation, an introduction, an initiation.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Oak.png" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>After a few miles on <a href="https://slconservancy.org/inspire/history-of-the-rancho-san-carlos/">Rancho San Carlos</a>, you drive up a steep and tortuous private road for three quarters of a mile. You are then greeted by a majestic oak tree, which acts as a natural gate to the estate. The hill spans 45 acres, 2 of which are dedicated to the homesite. You are now invited to discover its secrets and treasures. Welcome to Totoro Hill!</p>

            <img src="pictures/Driveway.png" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>You continue up the driveway, surrounded by younger oak trees.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Flat.png" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Soon, you reach a flat area. On the left, a 2-car garage and the workshops, one for wood, and one for metal. On the right, the main house. In between, the caretaker house. All five structures are connected by pergolas. The paved road stops at the flat area, and is replaced b gravel. Listen to the sound it makes when walking on it. Would you like to take your shoes off?</p>

            <img src="pictures/Front.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>From the front, the buildings do not reveal many of their secrets.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Back.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>But from the back, they are wide open to the surrounding environment. Their style is resolutely modern, with mostly straight lines and a minimalist inclination. But it is not austere nor cold. Instead, the intentional use of steel, aluminum, stone, concrete, and wood creates a warm and inviting feeling. Your hands want to touch the materials, feel the grains of wood, stone, and concrete, dip into the water of the many fountains sprinkled all around.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Monet.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Water can be found everywhere on the homesite. Totoro Hill is an oasis within an oasis. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_abyme">mise en abyme</a>. A wall fountain next to the main house's entrance points you in the right direction. A lap pool between the main house and the oak forest flowing downhill doubles as a moat and water reservoir. A bathhouse on the Eastern side combines sauna, jaccuzi, and cold plunge with crushed ice dispenser. And three fountains mark the path leading to the guest house and zen shrine located at the Southern border of the homesite. When looking at one of them, one name should come to mind: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet">Monet</a>.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Pool.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>The lap pool brings moisture into the main house.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Bathtub.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>The jacuzzi and cold plunge of the bathhouse are open to the outdoor.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Plumbing.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Indoor, all plumbing fixtures are visible.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Bench.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Raw materials are used everywhere. This bench is an invitation to sit down, slow your breathing, close your eyes, and listen to the sound of nature.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Rocks.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>These rocks break our straight lines, and remind us that we are only guests on this wild land.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Table.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>The imperfections of the lumber are what makes it perfect.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Corten.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>The corten steel of the fireplace gracefully age like our suntanned skins.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Stone.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Some walls are left unfinished. The temple's construction is a never-ending enterprise.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Passage.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Wherever solid ground is needed, concrete complements the gravel.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Walkway.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>But these rectangular slabs are always balanced by natural boulders and stones.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Pivot.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>All windows and openings are positioned in relation to outdoor features.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Frame.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Some windows and openings reinforce the contrast between indoor and outdoor.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Walls.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Others erase it entirely, bringing indoor and outdoor together.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Corridor.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Corridors create this contrast in a cinematic fashion.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Pergola.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Pergolas reinforce it geometric way.</p>
            
            <img src="pictures/Nook.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>A handful of nooks and crannies create delight.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Perspective.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>And perspectives create a multi-layer depth of field: wall, opening, bench, treeline, ridgeline, skyline, *ad infinitum*.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Oaktree.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>Surrounding oaktrees frame the estate.</p>

            <img src="pictures/Sunset.jpg" class="img-fluid mt-5">
            <p>And the sky is its roof.</p>
